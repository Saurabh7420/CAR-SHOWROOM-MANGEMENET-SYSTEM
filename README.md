PROJECT TITLE- CAR SHOWROOM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

GROUP-7

The Car Showroom Management System is a Java-based application developed by  GROUPD - 7
to streamline and enhance the daily operations of a car dealership. Designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles,
this system efficiently manages the core components of a showroom—vehicles, employees, and the showroom infrastructure itself. By centralizing data management
into a single, user-friendly platform, the system reduces the risk of human error, cuts down on manual labor, and improves overall organizational efficiency.

The system is divided into three main modules: Car Management, Employee Management, and Showroom Management. The Car Management module 
handles detailed records for each vehicle, including brand, model, manufacturing year, price, and availability. This allows for efficient tracking
and updating of the showroom inventory. The Employee Management module maintains important staff information such as employee names, unique
IDs, roles, and contact details, enabling streamlined communication and human resource management. Meanwhile, the Showroom Management module
keeps track of showroom-specific details like location, capacity, and the current inventory of cars, offering a clear overview of showroom performance and space utilization.

Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as encapsulation are carefully applied throughout the system to ensure that each component—cars,
employees, and the showroom—manages its own data and behavior independently. This modular design not only promotes clean, maintainable code but 
also supports scalability and adaptability, making the system suitable for both small-scale dealerships and larger automotive businesses. In essence,
the Showroom Management System offers a robust, flexible solution that simplifies data handling, enhances operational workflow, and prepares showrooms for future growth.
